h1. Unobtrusive datePicker Widgit

An attempt at writing a framework-free, keyboard accessible datePicker.

h2. At a glance

* Keyboard shortcuts adhere to "The DHTML Style Guide Working Group (DSGWG) recommendations":http://dev.aol.com/dhtml_style_guide#datepicker
* Accessibility enhancements including support for ARIA Roles and States
* The script can parse and format dates using a subset of the "PHP date":http://www.php.net/date/ conversion specifiers
* Both upper and lower date limits can be set
* Bespoke days of the week can be disabled
* Bespoke dates can be disabled/enabled and wildcards used to stipulate the dates in question
* Bespoke days of the week can be highlighted  
* Works with any combination of text inputs or select lists  
* DOM friendly - the calendar is only added to the DOM when actually required
* Includes a "smart" localisation option
* Can display an optional status bar and week numbers
* Can be dragged within the viewport by the user
* Global configuration parameters can be specified using JSON within the script tag itself
* The "button" used for popup datePickers can be arbitrarily positioned within the DOM and removed from the document tabindex if so desired
* The "button" updates to show a small cursor should the associated form element(s) contain a valid date
* Inline datePickers possible (i.e. no button activation is required), are automatically added to the document tabindex and can be arbitrarily positioned within the DOM
* A bespoke final opacity can be defined and the fade in/out animation effect disabled 
* The entire grid can be filled with dates    
* The "Today" button can be removed from the U.I.
* Fully skinnable with CSS
